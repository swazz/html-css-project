        When most people think of traveling abroad to Europe: Paris, London, or 
        Rome come to mind. However, just a little further north is Europe's diamond, 
        the city of Edinburgh.
        The city has so much to offer in terms of history and culture.
    </p>
    <p>
        Edinburgh, the capital of Scotland, is divided into the medieval Old Town and the Georgian-era New Town.
        This blend of old and "new" make the city a fascinating place to visit. 
        The wide streets of the New Town are in direct contrast with the Old Towns tiny closes.
    </p>
    <p>
        One thing Edinburgh has to offer is a spectacular castle. At the top of the Royal Mile, 
        Edinburgh castle sits high above much of the town. Part of the castle dates back to the 12th century. 
        Here visitors can see the Honors of Scotland (crown jewels) and the Stone of Destiny.
    </p>
    <p>
        Another exciting aspect of Edinburgh is its many festivals. 
        From the Edinburgh International festival to the funky Fringe festival, there is something for everyone. This year,
        from August 15 - 31, the city hosts a book festival where visitors may meet some of their favorite authors.
    </p>
    <p>
         Edinburgh also has numerous restaurants which serve dishes from traditional haggis to spicy curry. 
        Scotland is well known for its whisky, and visitors may have a wee taste of whiskey at the numerous shops or 
        at the Bow bar.

                            Britannia was the only ship in the world whose Captain traditionally was an Admiral. 
                            Nowhere on her side will you see her name, yet she is recognised around the world. 
                            She was built for the dual role of becoming a hospital ship if needed.

                            it is clear why the Royal Yacht's decommissioning was so sad for her.

                                    Ancient, malevolent energies pervade The Ghost Bus, and as you take in the famous landmarks and absorb the brutal history of Edinburgh,</li>
                                   <li>  you might find that the bus harbours a few dark passengers of its own.</li>
                                    And who could be surprised, considering its history as a chariot for the dead? 
                       <p>
                            NOTE: The bus is perfectly safe. On the off-chance that a spirit does manifest itself, our staff are highly trained to deal with the supernatural and will make sure that no passenger is in danger from any paranormal activity.
                                History, sightseeing, drama and the supernatural, all in one frightful evening.
